This directory contains disk images that create a richly configured Ubuntu linux virtual machine
that can be run on any computer that runs the VirtualBox software.

The machine contains a full installation of Anaconda3, LaTeX, and other useful tools
The econ-ark toolkit is installed using the conda installer that comes with Anaconda
Repositories that use the toolkit are stored at:

/usr/local/share/GitHub/econ-ark
./DemARK
./REMARK

The machine should automatically login with a user named econ-ark. 
The password is `econ-ark` spelled backwards: `kra-noce`

The recommended way to install your own VM is to copy the "VirtualBox" directory to some other place where you want 
to store the created VM, and follow the instructions thereafer
